ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Coach, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer on a quest to explore the depths of neural networks and their vast applications. Currently, I'm diving into the fascinating world of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for my final year project, where I'm employing transfer learning techniques to revolutionise forensic handwriting analysis. Through leveraging the PyGeNN framework, I aim to enhance the verification processes of handwritten documents, making them more accurate and efficient.

ðŸš€ My project not only stands at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and forensic science but also symbolises my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning. By training models on the Omniglot dataset and innovating with dual input systems for SNNs, I'm exploring new horizons in feature fusion and sequential stroke modeling.

ðŸŒ± I'm on a long and exciting track towards becoming a Machine Learning Engineer, and I believe in the power of collaboration, continuous learning, and sharing knowledge. Whether it's through contributing to open source, engaging in community discussions, or documenting my journey and learnings, I'm passionate about adding value to the ML community.

ðŸ’¡ I'm always open to connecting with fellow enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone intrigued by the potential of machine learning. Let's collaborate, innovate, and learn from each other as we navigate the complexities of AI together.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where I share my progress, experiments, and the challenges I've encountered along the way. Let's build the future of machine learning, one project at a time!
